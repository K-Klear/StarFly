# StarFly

Version 0.3:

- Space travel over the three stages (planet/space/orbit) implemented including simple transition animations.
- Got a working event system with proper branching etc.
- Skillchecks are pretty barebones (and deteministic), but they do for now
- Missions now get correctly finished on arrival
- Improved the UI focus system a bit

Version 0.2:

- Updated graphics a bit. Mostly placeholder, but looking good
- Crew can now be talked to/assigned positions/ordered around the ship directly through the graphical part.
