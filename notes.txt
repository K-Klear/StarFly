Bugs:
- math.randomseed() called in crew.lua for now. Move it into bootstrapper when that's a thing that exists.
- pathfinding for crew is a mess. It works, but oh god so ugly. I should go back to that at some point.

Version 0.4:
- Added a CREW dialog. Wages can be set, negotiated and crewmembers dismissed.
- Reworked the whole GUI. Now it's all GO's with collision objects.
- Conversation system in place. Very similar to the one used for events.
	- A new "brain.lua" module takes care of decisions, counterpart of "dice.lua" for events
- Crewmembers have a table that stores whatver issues they have, such as not being paid.
	- Depending on various factory they may bring these issues up when talked to, refuse to work unless satisfied or threaten to leave.


Z levels:
-1....0: ship and space
0.001: cargo
0.1...0.5: crew (if max_crew ever becomes higher than 9, this may need to be changed)
0.8...1: dialogs

Issue urgency levels (checked in the local crew.lua function "add_issue()":
0 - 1: no action
1 - 2: will bring it up in conversation
2 - 3: will demand you talk to them about it
4 +  : will give ultimatum (quit, stop working etc)

Characters traits currently in use:
confidence - affects skill self-assessment
skillfulness - how confident they think they can get a job if they try
dishonesty - how likely they are to lie
greed - how big of a share they want
boldness - affect issue urgency levels
responsibility - how likely they complain they have no work

EVENT JSON formatting:

Room name is displayed at the top
Text in the body (minus links) is in the body, duh.

Each "room" has one of three tags:

end
	Automatically offers a single choice (OK) and ends the event
choice
	Provide multiple choices, event continues according to player choice
dice
	Doesn't display to the player but makes a check and proceeds accordingly.
		difficulty:### sets the number to beat
		test:XXX sets what is being rolled (luck, flee, detect etc. - needs to be set up in dice.lua)
	Success goes to the first branch, failure to the second one. To get more branches, make more consecutive dice rooms.

tag effect:XXX (recruit_random for example) has an in game effect.

DIALOGUE JSON formatting:

Room name is ignored (instead there's "XXX says" and a face icon)
Text in the body consists of snips aimed at conversation.lua

New tag:
brain
	Similar to dice, but points to brain.lua. Used for decisions and circumstances concerning the speaker.
	Doesn't use the difficulty tag, so there's only brain:XXX.
	Returns integer pointing to the chosen link. Defaults to 1: yes / 2: no.
