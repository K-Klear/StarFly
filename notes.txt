EVENT JSON formatting:

Room name is displayed at the top
Text in the body (minus links) is in the body, duh.

Each "room" has one of three tags:

end
	Automatically offers a single choice (OK) and ends the event
choice
	Provide 1-3 choices, event continues according to player choice
dice
	Doesn't display to the player but makes a check and proceeds accordingly.
		difficulty:### sets the number to beat
		test:XXX sets what is being rolled (luck, flee, detect etc. - needs to be set up in dice.lua)
	Success goes to the first branch, failure to the second one. To get more branches, make more consecutive dice rooms.

tag effect:XXX (recruit_random for example) has an in game effect set up in event loop in interface script.

DIALOGUE JSON formatting:

Room name is ignored (instead there's "XXX says")
Text in the body consists of snips aimed at talk.lua
