Stage types:
"choice" - Displays values from table "values" as well as multiple choices. On player input moves to defined stages.
"dice" - Performs a test using "dice_type" and "dice_difficulty" and moves onto stage defined in "success" or "failure".
"end" - Displays final values and closes the dialog after player clicks "OK".

More to come, maybe
